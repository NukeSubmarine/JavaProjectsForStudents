# A Basic Calculator

In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:
- Add two integers
- Subtract two integers
- Multiply two integers
- Divide two integers
- Apply the modulo operator on two integers

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore more in the learning environment.

**Important:** Moving forward, all projects will require that you define the main method manually. When you click the “Save” button below, an attempt to run your Java code is made. However, Java will return an error if you attempt to run a Java program without first defining a main method. If you encounter such an error, do not worry, you can define the main method ahead of time in order to avoid seeing the error.

## Basic Calculator

1. **Create a public class called Calculator.**


   ```java

## Basic Calculator

1. **Create a public class called Calculator.**
   ```java
   //To create a class called Abacus, for example, you could use syntax like:

    public class Abacus{

    }

    ```

2. **Inside of the class, create a Calculator() constructor.** You can leave the contents of the constructor empty.

   To create a constructor for an Abacus class, you could use syntax like:
   ```java
   public class Abacus {
       public Abacus() {
   
       }
   }
